# React, Redux & Sass Starter
A simple and quick way to get you going with developing React applications with Redux and Sass.

Comes with pre-configured Webpack for bundling your application to help save time in setting up your project. Keeps CSS out of JavaScript to maintain separation of concerns. Redux takes care of State Management. If you are looking for _CSS-in-JS_ approach, this starter pack is not for you.

**Demo:** https://www.gigacore.in/demos/react-redux-demo/

For a complex example with Async actions, take a look at: [react-weather-forecast](https://github.com/Gigacore/react-weather-forecast)

### Components ðŸ”© Styles ðŸŽ¨ Action! ðŸŽ¬

With all necessary tools in place, all you need to do is start creating React Components, style them and optionally use Redux for the State management. It is recommended that you use Redux if the applications you are building require interactions between multiple components or that requires pulling data from external source.

All the required code (JS + Sass) goes inside the ```src``` folder. Webpack will compile, bundle and output in the ```public``` folder, which you can upload/deploy to the root directory of your web server to publish your app!

### Get started!
```
git clone
cd React-Redux-Sass-Starter
npm i
```

### Start the dev server:
```

npm run start:dev

```

### Build:
```

npm run build

```

#### Note:
* Changes made to your CSS / JS triggers a full page auto-reload.
* Running a build writes the ```bundle.js``` and ```bundle.css``` to the ```/public/dist/``` directory.

### Pre-configured tools and plugins

* Module bundler: [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* ES6 Transpiler: [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader)
* Linting: [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
* JS Uglification: [UglifyJsPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin/)
* Dev Server: [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) (```npm run start:dev```)
